This is a Redux-React Todo App exercise from [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon)'s Egghead series [Getting started with Redux][1].

I coded along while watching the video, and added comments to explain each piece of code.

I also wrote notes on my learnings in this [gist][2].

To run, use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
